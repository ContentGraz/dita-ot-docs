<concept id="pdf-plugin-structure">
  <title>PDF plug-in structure</title>
  <shortdesc>PDF customization plug-ins typically organize files in a folder structure that mimics the hierarchy of the
    default PDF plug-in. This method facilitates comparisons with the default settings in the base PDF
    plug-in.</shortdesc>

  <conbody>
    <section id="the_customization_folder">
      <title>The Customization folder</title>
      <p>This customization approach was introduced with the Idiom plug-in, which provided a dedicated Customization
        folder to store overrides to the PDF transformation. While this method is deprecated in recent toolkit versions,
        the same organization principles can be used in custom PDF plug-ins.</p>
      <note type="tip">If you follow the recommended
        <xref href="pdf-customization-best-practices.dita"/> and create a custom PDF plug-in, the following information
        on the <filepath>Customization</filepath> folder will apply to the root folder of your custom plug-in.</note>
      <p>The Customization directory is used to store customized versions of the default PDF plug-in files. DITA-OT will
        look for certain files here to override the standard ones when publishing PDF output. </p>
      <p>Things you can currently override include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Custom XSL via <filepath>xsl/custom.xsl</filepath> and <filepath>attrs/custom.xsl</filepath></li>
        <li>Layout overrides via <filepath>layout-masters.xsl</filepath></li>
        <li>Font overrides via <filepath>font-mappings.xml</filepath></li>
        <li>Per-locale variable overrides via <filepath>common/vars/[language].xml</filepath></li>
        <li>I18N configuration via <filepath>i18n/[language].xml</filepath></li>
        <li>Index configuration via <filepath>index/[language].xml</filepath></li>
      </ul>
      <p>When customizing any of these areas, modify the relevant file(s) in the <filepath>Customization</filepath>
        folder. Then, to enable the changes in the publishing process, you find the corresponding entry for each file
        you modified in the <filepath>catalog.xml</filepath> file.</p>
      <p>It should look like this:</p>
      <codeblock>&lt;!--uri name="cfg:fo/attrs/custom.xsl" uri="fo/attrs/custom.xsl"/--&gt;</codeblock>
      <p>Remove the comment markers <codeph>!--</codeph> and <codeph>--</codeph> to enable the change:</p>
      <codeblock>&lt;uri name="cfg:fo/attrs/custom.xsl" uri="fo/attrs/custom.xsl"/&gt;</codeblock>
      <p>Your customization should now be enabled as part of the publishing process.</p>
      <p>DITA-OT provides template files that you can start with throughout the <filepath>Customization</filepath>
        directory structure. These files end in the suffix <codeph>.orig</codeph> (for example,
          <filepath>catalog.xml.orig</filepath>). To enable these files, make a copy of them and remove the
          <codeph>.orig</codeph> suffix. For example, copy <filepath>catalog.xml.orig</filepath> to
          <filepath>catalog.xml</filepath>. You can then make modifications to the copy.</p>
      <p>The files in this directory and its subfolders will override the out-of-the-box settings from their
        counterparts in <filepath>cfg/fo/attrs</filepath> and <filepath>xsl/fo</filepath>.</p>

    <section id="custom_artwork_the_common_artwork_folder">
      <title>Custom artwork: the <filepath>common/artwork</filepath> folder</title>
      <p>This folder houses custom artwork files that override the standard ones in
          <filepath>cfg/common/artwork</filepath>. These files are used to graphically identify different types of DITA
          <xmlelement>note</xmlelement> element.</p>
      <p>The mapping between <xmlelement>note</xmlelement> type and graphic is contained in a subset of the
        locale-dependent variable files, such as</p>
      <codeblock>cfg/common/vars</codeblock>
      <p>The variables that control <xmlelement>note</xmlelement> graphics all follow the form</p>
      <codeblock>  &lt;variable id="{type} Note Image Path"&gt; {Path to image file} &lt;/variable&gt;</codeblock>
      <p>where {type} contains a possible value for the <xmlelement>note</xmlelement>
        <xmlatt>type</xmlatt> attribute.</p>

    <section id="index_configuration_the_common_index_folder">
      <title>Index configuration: the <filepath>common/index</filepath> folder</title>
      <p>This folder houses custom index definition files that override the standard ones in
          <filepath>cfg/common/index</filepath>. Each file contains data for a single language, and should take that
        language’s ISO 639-1 language designator as its name (for example, <filepath>pt.xml</filepath> for Portuguese).
        If necessary, locale-specific customizations can be provided by adding a region designator to the file name (for
        example, <filepath>pt_BR.xml</filepath> for Brazilian Portuguese).</p>
      <p>The index files consist of <xmlelement>index.group</xmlelement> elements which contain sorting information on
        one or more characters. Index groups are listed in sort order (“specials“ before numbers, numbers before the
        letter ‘A‘, etc), and the <xmlelement>char.set</xmlelement> entries they contain are also listed in sort order
        (uppercase before lowercase).</p>
      <p>The best way to start editing a custom index file is by making a copy of the original from
          <filepath>cfg/common/index</filepath> and making changes as desired.</p>
      <p>In order to apply a custom index definition to your publishing outputs, edit
          <filepath>Customization/catalog.xml</filepath> and uncomment the appropriate entry in the “Index configuration
        override entries“ section.</p>

    <section id="variable_overrides_the_common_vars_folder">
      <title>Variable overrides: the <filepath>common/vars</filepath> folder</title>
      <p>This folder houses custom variable definitions that override the standard ones in
          <filepath>cfg/common/vars</filepath>. As with index configuration, Each file contains data for a single
        language, and should take that language’s ISO 639-1 language designator as its name.</p>
      <p>Variable files contain a set of <xmlelement>variable</xmlelement> elements, identified by their
          <xmlatt>id</xmlatt> attribute. The variable definitions are used to store static text that is used as part of
        the published outputs. For example, page headers, hyperlinks, etc. The id attribute for each variable should
        make it clear how the variable text is being used.</p>
      <p>Some variables contain <xmlelement>param</xmlelement> elements which indicate parameter values that are
        substituted at publish time by the XSL. For example, a page number that is being generated as part of the
        publishing process might be identified by &lt;param ref-name="number"/&gt; When editing or translating a
        variable file, these should be included in the translation, though they can be moved and rearranged within the
          <xmlelement>variable</xmlelement> content as needed.</p>
      <p>The best way to start editing a custom variables file is by making a copy of the original from
          <filepath>cfg/common/vars</filepath> and making changes as desired. When adding a new language, start from an
        existing language’s list of variables and translate each entry as needed.</p>
      <p>Note that unchanged <xmlelement>variable</xmlelement> elements can be omitted: the custom variables file need
        only include those <xmlelement>variable</xmlelement> elements which you have modified. Variables not found in
        the custom file will are taken from the standard variable files.</p>
      <p>Applying a custom variable does not require modifying the <filepath>Customization/catalog.xml</filepath> file.
        The publishing process will automatically use any custom variables definitions in place of the original
        ones.</p>

    <section id="custom_attributes_the_fo_attrs_folder">
      <title>Custom attributes: the <filepath>fo/attrs</filepath> folder</title>
      <p>This folder houses custom attribute configuration files that override the standard ones in
          <filepath>cfg/fo/attrs</filepath>. These files define the appearance of different elements in XML assets when
        they are rendered to PDF output. The different DITA elements are organized into files by element type –
        index-related definitions in <filepath>index-attr.xsl</filepath>, table-related definitions in
          <filepath>tables-attr.xsl</filepath>, etc.</p>
      <p>The XSL attribute sets defined in these files can be used to override the presentation of DITA elements,
        including font size, color, spacing, etc.</p>

      <p>Each configuration file contains mappings of certain symbols to the Unicode codepoint which should be used to
