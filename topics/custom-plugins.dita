    <section id="plugin-benefits">
      <p>The DITA-OT plug-in mechanism provides the following benefits:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Plug-ins can easily be shared with other users, teams, or companies. Typically, all users need to do is to
          unzip and run a single installation command. With many builds, even that installation step is automatic.</li>
        <li>Plug-ins permit overrides or customizations to grow from simple to complex over time, with no increased
          complexity to the extension mechanism.</li>
        <li>Plug-ins can be moved from version to version of the DITA-OT simply by reinstalling or copying the directory
          from one installation to another. There is no need to re-integrate code based on updates to the core
          processing of the DITA-OT.</li>
        <li>Plug-ins can build upon each other. If you like a plug-in, simply install that plug-in, and then create your
          own plug-in that builds on top of it. The two plug-ins can then be distributed to your team as a unit, or you
          can share your own extensions with the original provider.</li>
      </ul>
